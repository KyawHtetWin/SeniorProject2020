# Running a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

You will find three different neural networks that you can open in a notebook like Jupyter or Google's colab notebook. However, because running and training a convolutional neural network requries a significant amount of computation, it's a bit cumbersome for you to experience this code release directly. 

Nevertheless, if you want to run a CNN during the code presentation, you can run a small convolutional network, named Handwritten Digit Classification, that classify handwritten digits. 

In addition, if you want to experience CNN that we built for our application to 
identify face shape, you can run them later at your convenience since it requires quite a bit of computational time depending on the machine. The dataset that I used to train can be found in the zip file. 

## Requirements if you want to run the code:
1. Install BLAS library - for fast tensor operations
2. Install Python scientific suite: Numpy and matplotlib
3. Install HDF5
5. Install Graphviz
6. Install TensorFlow 
7. Install Keras

Please google how to install them for your machine.
