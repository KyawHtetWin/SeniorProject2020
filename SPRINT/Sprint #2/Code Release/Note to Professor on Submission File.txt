Cat_vs_dog_CNN is the CNN tutorial that I follow from the book Deep Learning in Python to learn about buidling
Convolutional Neural Network.

3 other files are CNN trained on the face shape dataset. 

The face shape dataset is as follows:
1. 400 training images
2. 50 validation images
3. 50 testing images

The first CNN that I built, named Face_Shape_Custom Model, is a fairly small convent .
Two other convents make use of pretrained convent, VGG16 and InceptionV3, both trained on ImageNet.

The best accuracy that is achieved so far, 60%, at detecting face shape is by using VGG16 model.
Right now, due to very little data, the model is overfitting.

In the next iteration, the model will be trained on larger dataset to mitigate overfitting.
