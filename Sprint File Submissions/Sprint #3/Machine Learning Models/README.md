# Running a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

To follow along with the machine learning demo, go to the file called Machine Learning Models and run the notebook titled (Demo)MobileNetV2. I suggest that you run this on Google Colab. In case you are not familiar, go to Google Drive -> New -> More, then you will be able open a Google Colab notebook. Moreover, I suggest that you upload image file dataset used in the demo called face_shape_one in this directory to your google drive, then all you have to do is put the file path in the notebook.
