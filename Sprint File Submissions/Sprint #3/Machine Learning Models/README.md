# Running a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

To follow along with the demo, you can run the file titled (Demo)MobileNetV2 notebook. I suggest that you run this on Google Colab. In case you are not familiar, go to Google Drive -> More, then
you will be able open a Google Colab notebook. Moreover, I suggest that you upload image file 
dataset used in the demo called face_shape_one in this directory to your google drive, then 
all you have to do is put the file path in the notebook.
